# GA Project 4- barber booking system
Problem statement: Going to the barber in your neighborhood is very tricky, as usually there are no online appointments that can be made.
you can only walk to your local barber and check for availability on the spot, or call them to make a booking.
chances are, you have encountered situations where you made an appointment and once you reach the shop, you realised that the barber is cutting someone's hair, and you have to wait at the shop.

Solution: this app helps local small barber to manage their appointments, and includes features like membership system to encourage customer loyalty
